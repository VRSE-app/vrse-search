        "paperAbstract": "The COVID19 pandemic has redefine the way nuclear medicine is practiced. The threat from COVID19 to health and to the nuclear medicine community is rapidly changing. During the acute phase of COVID19, there were significant direct and indirect impacts on nuclear medicine practice that have been previously detailed (1,2). It is useful to consider how COVID19 will shape nuclear medicine practice as we re-emerge from the acute phase (first wave) and prepare for both the second wave and practice after the COVID19 crisis. With the impact and the Government responses varying across the globe, there is some value in gleaning a global perspective. Here, a perspective from an Australian and New Zealand context is provided.",

Anahtar Sozcukler: Corona virus, Pandemi, Pediyatri, Cocuk ABSTRACT: Corona viruses have led to outbreaks at various times throughout history. Generally, infection caused by Corona viruses progresses asymptomatically in healthy children and rarely causes morbidity and mortality. Despite this fact, the infection may cause a severe clinical picture in the elderly and adults and children with predisposing underlying disease. The novel Corona virus outbreak, which started in China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world and turned into a pandemic. This pandemic, named as COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Organisation), caused economic and social losses all over the world and caused more than 450,000 deaths worldwide up to 21 June. COVID-19, whose specific antiviral therapy and preventive vaccine is not yet available, is still the most serious health problem in the world.

        "paperAbstract": "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is the worst healthcare emergency of this century, and its impact on pediatrics and neonatology is still largely unknown. The European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) launched the EPICENTRE (ESPNIC Covid pEdiatric Neonatal Registry) international, multicenter, and multidisciplinary initiative to study the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. EPICENTRE background and aims are presented together with protocol details. EPICENTRE is open to centers all over the world, and this will allow to provide a pragmatic picture of the epidemic, with a particular attention to pediatric and neonatal critical care issues. Conclusions : EPICENTRE will allow researchers to clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, refining its clinical management and hopefully providing new insights for clinicians. What is Known: • COVID19 is the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is spreading around the globe. • Majority of data available about SARS-CoV-2 infections originates from adult patients. What is New: • EPICENTRE is the first international, multicenter, multidisciplinary, meta-data driven, hospital-based, online, prospective cohort registry dedicated to neonatal and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections. • EPICENTRE will allow to understand epidemiology and physiopathology of COVID19.",

        "title": "COVID19 and Breastfeeding: Not That Simple",
        "paperAbstract": "Dear Editor, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current emerging viral disease (caused by a novel coronavirus referred as SARS-­CoV-2)­ with­ a­ rapidly­ growing­ case­ notification­ rate­ since­its­first­identification­in­Wuhan,­Hubei­Province,­China,­ in­ December­ 2019.­ Hence,­ the­ World­ Health­ Organization­ (WHO)­Emergency­Committee­declared­a­global­health­emergency based on this ongoing outbreak (Zhu et al., 2020). To date, a paucity of data is currently available regarding the association of COVID-19 with pregnancy and, especially, with breastfeeding (Rasmussen et al., 2020). No international or national guidelines have been proposed to date. Favre et al. have recommended the systematic screening of any suspected COVID-19 infections during pregnancy­ and,­ if­ COVID-19­ infection­ is­ confirmed,­ they­ have proposed an extended followup for both mothers and fetus (Favre et al., 2020).­ In­ specific­ cases­ of­ COVID-19­ infection­confirmed­before­delivery,­the­authors­did­not­recommend breastfeeding (Favre et al., 2020). However,­to­our­knowledge,­no­data­have­supported­that­ SARSCoV-2 could be transmitted through breastmilk (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Interestingly, Chen et al. did not demonstrate any presence of SARSCoV-2 in the breastmilk of six infected mothers (Chen et al., 2020). Similarly, we already know that SARSCoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that also cause severe respiratory illness, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARSCoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), with a nucleotide identity to SARSCoV and MERSCoV of 79% and 50%, respectively (Lu et al., 2020). Evidence of viral passage into breastmilk was not demonstrated for either of these viruses. Given­the­fact­that­the­health­benefits­of­breastfeeding­are­ widely acknowledged (Kramer & Kakuma, 2012), and taking into account that SARSCoV-2 was not detected in breastmilk in COVID-19infected women, it is currently questionable to dissuade breastfeeding in such cases. The temporary separation of a newborn from its symptomatic mother may be considered prudent, but the use of a breastpump may be provided during this isolation, in particular if the viral detection of SARSCoV-2 is negative. Furthermore,­based­on­the­first­available­data­(Chen et al., 2020), there is currently no evidence to suggest that the development of COVID-19 during pregnancy could lead to the occurrence of severe adverse outcomes in neonates nor intrauterine vertical transmission. Until the publication of forthcoming new data, these highly specific­situations­should­be­managed­with­a­multidisciplinary­ team,­on­a­case-­by-­case­basis,­after­explanation­of­benefits/ risks. Guidelines and management should rapidly evolve with the best understanding of the SARSCoV-2 infection.",

        "paperAbstract": "Introduction: In December 31, 2019, China gave bad news the World Health Organization (WHO) throughtout an outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia characteristic in Wuhan, which is located in Hubei Province with 11 million people. On 1 January 2020, the source of the Coronavirus outbreak is a seafood market that has been closed. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, where the virus was first detected, fit that description to a tee, with vendors illegally trading in wild and exotic animals alongside the daily ocean catch. Discussion: This literature review retrieved the articles from databases such as Springer, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The articles on preventing were 17 articles and curbing were 15 articles. The literatur review is a critical and in-depth evaluation of previous research to obtain important information about the dangers of the corona virus and the important of preventing and curbing the corona virus. Guidance regarding personal protective equipment in infection prevention and control is provided by WHO. Goggles and face shield must always be used to protect against potential hazards, and health workers don’t touch mucous membranes (eyes, nose or mouth). Conclusion: Recommendations for preventing health and preventing Covid19 are: limiting physical contact or being in a room with people without symptoms, covering the mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and then throwing the tissue into the trash. If there are no tissues, use your sleeves to avoid liquids or droplets on other people or sticking to nearby objects, do not travel to the red zone against the spread of Covid19, rub hands properly for 20 seconds with soap and water, If it is quite difficult to find water, it is advisable to always have a Hand Sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% which is believed to be able to kill germs. Recommendation for curbing the spread the Covid19 include: lockdown, stay at home, and physical inactivity.",

The presence of COVID-19 infection may precipitate underlying prothrombotic lesions like iliac vein compression although this has not been reported prior. To date, there are no inter-societal consensus guidelines on the role and optimal dose of chemical prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE)",

        "paperAbstract": "Background. The unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemics on modern society has ignited a \"gold rush\" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of economical, scientific and human resources towards dedicated clinical research. We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods. We developed informatic tools (Covid Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time growth rate, geographical distribution and characteristics of Covid-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints and study designs. Data and analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT Results. We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions. This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth sheds doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable result. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for Covid19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs. Covid Trial Monitor identifies critical issues in current Covid19-related clinical research and represents a useful resource for researchers and policymakers to improve the quality and efficiency of related trials",

This lesson was learned from a systematic examination of emerging critical global transitions in health, environment, and technology, punctuated by a real-time example of a globally disruptive event, the COVID19 pandemic. This viral pandemic laid bare the health, economic, social, and educational vulnerabilities of societies and exposed the lack of foresight that resulted in ill-equipped responses on multiple fronts.",

        "paperAbstract": "The impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is widespread and will likely shape community behavior for months to come. And while the humanitarian and safety-related aspects of this outbreak are top of mind globally, it’s unquestionable that social distancing, quarantining, and staying home will have a significant effect on media consumption, which could rise up to 60%, according to recent research from Nielsen’s U.S. media team.  Social media, now a part of everyday life for most consumers engaged with the world digitally, became the primary source for buzz about all things COVID-19 as worries and news intensified. Sentiment analysis is applied in this study to analyze the opinions, feelings, and interests of individuals in the COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to analyze sentiment based on an opinion by classifying individual feelings such as sadness, happiness, or panic in facing a COVID-19 into sentiment level that is negative, positive or, neutral. In this paper, an open-source approach is presented where we have collected tweets from the Twitter API and then reprocessing, analyzing and, visualizing these tweets using python. Furthermore, Twitter data streaming will be processed and cleaned to parse data that can be classified based on opinion with a text mining algorithm using text blob Python. Feature extraction is done for the relationship between words by the Bigram and N-gram methods.",

Some of these challenges include closure of substance use treatment clinics, focus of emergency departments on COVID-19 patients, social distancing and shelter in place orders affecting mental health, bystander overdose rescue, threats to income and supply of substances for people who use drugs. While the initial changes in regulation allowing buprenorphine prescribing by telehealth are welcomed by providers and patients, many additional innovations are required to ensure that additional vulnerabilities and hurdles created by this pandemic scenario do not further fan the flames of the opioid epidemic.",

        "paperAbstract": "This study examines the relationship between the spreads of COVID-19 and health system spending in the South-East Asia Region (SEAR). We have taken two potential indicators of health system financing – per capita government health expenditure and government health expenditure as a percentage of general government expenditure. Further, we have taken two indicators for COVID19 – total confirmed cases and total fatality rate (death rate). We found that the stronger health system financing countries reduce the spreads of COVID-19 sooner than the lower spending country. The suggestion could be increased funding on health infrastructure as well as human resources lead to enhance the detection and testing capacity of any health system irrespective of any infectious disease.",

Limited data on the direct impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy shows women who are Black, obese and with co-morbidities are at higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Younger age groups in Africa and South Asia have shown increased COVID-19 mortality. Indigenous pregnant women in Pacific Island countries are likely to be high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of diabetes and obesity. It is important to involve pregnant women in research, especially with regards to vaccine development and therapeutics.",

        "title": "Kinderreanimation während SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie – eine Balance zwischen Eigenschutz und Faktor Zeit",
        "paperAbstract": "Mit Interesse haben wir die COVID19-LeitliniendesEuropeanResuscitation Council gelesen.Währendwirdie aufExpertenkonsens beruhenden Empfehlungen hinsichtlich der Schutzmaßnahmen bei Erwachsenen voll und ganz nachvollziehen können, halten wir die Empfehlungen für Kinder und Neugeborene in der Risiko-Nutzen-Abwägung für etwas unverhältnismäßig. UmdasRisikoeinerTransmissionvon SARS-COV-2 auf das medizinische Personal zuminimieren, wird durch die Autoren auch für Reanimationen im Kindesalter das Tragen einer persönlichen Schutzausrüstung empfohlen, „wenn es sich umKindmitVerdacht . . . auf Covid19-Infekt handelt“ [1]. Gerade in den Herbstund Wintermonaten liegt die Inzidenz von Infektionen der oberen Luftwege bei Kindern im Alter zwischen 0 und 6 Jahren bei etwa 0,5 pro Person pro Monat [2]. In diesen Monaten ist also davon auszugehen, dass wenigstens 50% aller Reanimationen bei Kindern unter COVID-19-Verdacht erfolgen. In diesen Fällen wird sich die Reanimation daher um die Zeit verzögern, die zum Anlegen der PSA (persönliche Schutzausrüstung) nach den Vorgaben des RKI benötigt wird. Derzeit liegt die Überlebensrate von Kindern mit HerzKreislauf-Stillstand (CA, Cardiac Arrest) bei lediglich ca. 6,7–10,2%, ohnewesentliche neurologische Defizite sogar nur bei ca. 1% [3]. Im Gegensatz zu einem CA bei Erwachsenen ist die Durchführung einer Reanimation im Kindesalter noch zeitkritischer. Hierfür erscheint der wesentlich höhere Anteil an Hypoxämie sowie die gleichzeitig deutlich reduzierte Hypoxämietoleranz ursächlich. Es muss daher die Frage gestellt werden, ob eine zeitliche Verzögerung durch das grundsätzliche Anlegen einer PSA (Schutzhandschuhe, Schutzkittel, Schutzbrille, FFP3-Maske) bei Kindern mit CA und Infektanamnese im Verhältnis zu einer möglichen Infektionsgefahr des Behandlers durch das zu reanimierende Kind steht. Zumal die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines COVID19-Infekts als Ursache des Herz-Kreislauf-Stillstands aufgrund der niedrigen Inzidenz sehr unwahrscheinlich ist. Bezüglich der Viruslast bei Kindern gibt es bisher nur eine Studie. Diese hat bisher nicht den Peer-Review-Prozess durchlaufen und auch nur eine verhältnismäßig geringe Anzahl an COVID-19positiven Kindern eingeschlossen [4]. Hier findet sich eine vergleichbare mittlereViruslast beiKindernundErwachsenen. Basierend darauf schlussfolgern die Autoren, dass Kinder genauso infektiös sind wie Erwachsene. Interessanterweise finden sich aber doch einige Unterschiede zwischen Kindern und Erwachsenen. So ist der prozentuale Anteil an Kindern mit einer Viruslast von >250.000 Kopien/ml – der Konzentration, bei der basierend auf Zellkulturstudien mit einer Infektiosität oberhalb von 5% zu rechnen ist – mit 29,0% deutlich geringer als bei über 20-Jährigen, bei denen der prozentuale Anteil bei 51,4% liegt. Außerdem finden sich in den älteren Altersgruppen Spitzenwerte der Viruslast, die um den Faktor 100 höher liegen, sodass die Anzahl der „Superspreader“ unter den Kindern geringer sein könnte. Rein epidemiologisch finden sich derzeit keinerlei Hinweise für eine hohe Infektiosität der Kinder. Im Gegenteil scheint die Infektiosität ebenso wie die Suszeptibilität für COVID-19 eher geringer zu sein als bei Erwachsenen, wobei auch hier der Großteil der Studien „non-peer-reviewed preprints“ sind. Tatsächlichmuss aufgrund der niedrigen Inzidenz bei Kindern zur epidemiologischen Abschätzung der Infektiosität auf Einzelbeispiele zurückgegriffen werden, auch wenn diese Daten sicherlich sehr vorsichtig interpretiert werden müs-",

        "paperAbstract": "The incidence of acute stroke during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is either increasing, decreasing, or neither.1–3 Published data fails to support a firm conclusion, whereas anecdotal reports and nonpeer-reviewed case series posted on preprint servers—although newsworthy—do not help clarify the effect of severe acute respiratory syndromecorona virus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection on the frequency of thrombotic events.1,4 One can speculate that fear of infection may lead potential stroke patients to refuse or delay calling for emergency medical services.5 However, the virus may be linked to thrombotic risk, which, in turn, could lead to an increased incidence of stroke, especially severe stroke.4 Therefore, a crucial need for data exists to characterize and understand the effect of the COVID19 pandemic on stroke care.",

        "paperAbstract": "A cluster of pneumonia (COVID‐19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). SARS‐CoV‐2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high‐risk population. People affected by SARS‐CoV‐2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission. COVID‐19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to COVID‐19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int). Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID‐19/ SARS‐CoV‐2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID‐19.",

        "paperAbstract": "The diffusion of Covid-19 has called governments and public health authorities to interventions aiming at limiting new infections and containing the expected number of critical cases and deaths. Most of these measures rely on the compliance of people, who are asked to reduce their social contacts to a minimum. In this note we argue that individuals’ adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually, it is possible that, if those who have many contacts have reduced them proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy could have backfired: the disease has taken more time to die out, up to the point that it has become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy may even be counterproductive.",

        "title": "HLA-B*44 and C*01 Prevalence Correlates with Covid19 Spreading across Italy",
        "paperAbstract": "The spread of COVID-19 is showing huge, unexplained, differences between northern and southern Italy. We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson’s coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value < 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson’s coefficients between −0.47 and −0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1–35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1–41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.",

        "paperAbstract": "The advent of a new Corona virus, SARS-CoVi-2, causing COVID-19, which first began in Wuhan, China, and then spread worldwide, has created a global public health crisis [1]. The sudden and far-reaching pandemic has raised many immediate questions. A very important goal of public health is to identify environmental factors that affect the spread and severity of the disease. Air pollution is one of the most well-known causes of long-term inflammation, which ultimately leads to increased immune system hyperactivity [2]. Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death and is estimated to play a role in nearly 5 million premature deaths worldwide in 2017 alone. Numerous scientific studies have linked air pollution to a variety of health concerns, including premature death in patients with heart or lung disease, non-fatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeats, and severe asthma [3].",

        "paperAbstract": "Background Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic. Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID19 have been reported & well described in different articles from different countries. This epidemic of Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. No articles depicting this pandemic have been published to date in Bangladesh. There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization in our country. A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media. This study aims to present basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments in our country. Methods In this retrospective, single centre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from Evercare Hospital (Dhaka, Bangladesh) who had been discharged or had died by May 31, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups. Group I: includes patients who survived from CoVid 19 disease & Group II: includes patients who died from CoVid 19 disease. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Results 50 patients from Evercare Hospital were included in this study, of whom 43 were discharged and 07 died in hospital. Mean age of group-I was 34.63±13.96 & that of group-II was 51.57±13.89. Among them 34 (68%) were male & 16 (32%) were female. 14 (28%) patients had a comorbidity, with smoking being the most common (25 [50%] patients), followed by diabetes (14 [28%] patients), ischaemic heart disease (13 [26%] patients) and hypertension (10 [20%] patients). Among the socio-economic condition majority of the study population belongs to middle class & majority had higher secondary education level which was statistically significant. Among the cardiac markers mean Creatine Kinase level was 68.34±98.31 which was statistically significant. Imaging profile of the study population was statistically significant. Among the DIC profile of the study population mean fibrinogen level was 298.02±135.95 which was statistically significant. Serum albumin & S. ALT levels were 3.28±0.55 & 66.16±94.69 respectively which were also significant. Among the septic markers of the study population the mean CRP & LDH levels were 3.56±6.26 & 241.44±210.39 respectively, which were statistically significant. Mean Sequential organ failure & qSOFA scores were 2.00±2.73 & 0.88±0.66 respectively which were also significant. Mean duration of viral shedding was 13.86±7.80. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 28 days. Demographic and Clinical Presentation of CoVid19 Patients in BangladeshA Single .. DOI: 10.9790/0853-1906103853 www.iosrjournal.org 39 | Page Conclusion The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and fibrinogen could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.",

        "paperAbstract": "The severe form of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has largely manifested as a predominant respiratory illness causing severe pneumonia characterized by bilateral, subpleural ground glass haze, progressing to consolidation, and fibrosis on imaging. There is some discrepancy between the governmental guidelines, professional Societies and Radiology and Respiratory Medicine specialists with divided opinions between the use of the chest X-rays and CT scan, and whether the use be screening or diagnostic. So far, the most balanced recommendations have been proposed by the Fleischner Society, which are endorsed by the Radiological Society of Pakistan as well. This writeup describes the approach for a rational use of imaging to the best advantage in the current situation according to local resources, and restricting the spread of infection. The most practical compromise for Pakistan appears to be the use of portable digital radiography equipment, and point-of- care ultrasound; with CT scan reserved for clinical situations not explained by the above two modalities, or demanding disease stratification.",

One of the keys to this success is consistent quarantine of individuals who have been in contact with suspected cases or who are entering Vietnam from an endemic country. Reliable diagnostics to end isolation of patients and quarantine of individuals at risk are an essential component of this strategy. In this study we report two cases of who were discharged after testing negative twice for SARS-CoV-2 and then tested positive again.

        "paperAbstract": "The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the importance of a mindful utilization of financial and human resources. Preventing infections and preserving resources and manpower are crucial in healthcare. It is important to ensure the ability of the surgeons and the specialized interventionalists to function through this pandemic. A tremendous effort should be achieved to minimize cross-infections in this sector. In addition, more efforts should be conducted to monitor surgical patients diagnosed with COVID-19 because they have higher mortality rates. A study by Lei et al. was conducted retrospectively on 34 patients with COVID-19 who underwent surgery. They reported that all patients developed COVID19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Also, they reported that 15 (44.1%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20.5%) died after admission to the ICU [1]. Another study was conducted in Italy regarding the protocols of dealing with operative patients in the era of COVID19 pandemic. They recommended that the designated COVID-19 operating areas must be allocated to the operating room closest to the entrance of the theater block entrance [2]. Also, they advised that patients’ transit to and from the operating room must be as quick as possible and a pre-defined direct pathway must be kept as short as possible and away from other patients within the hospital in order to minimize the chances of cross-infection. In addition, they recommended to minimize the number of operators and other staff who should be equipped with personal protection equipment. At the end of the operation and during the recovery phase, the patient must be assisted directly in the operation room until ready to be transferred back to the inpatients place of stay. The time needed to return to wards must be reduced in order to minimize contact between COVID-19 positive patients and the surrounding environment [2]. The role of personal protection equipment was emphasized by Bianco et al. [3]. Another important point is how to stratify elective surgery during the pandemic. Stahel recommended that elective operations can be stratified into “essential“, which implies that there is an increased risk of adverse outcomes by delaying surgical care, versus “non-essential “or “discretionary“, which implies that there is no increased risk [4]. Moreover, Chadi et al. hypothesized that the minimal-invasive surgery has more advantages in a safe and controlled fashion [5]. However, they recommended ultimately to proceed with technical approaches they are comfortable with to ensure no added risk to the patient and operating room team occur [5]. Theoretically and practically, the aforementioned protocols carry a risk for hospital facilities contamination, and healthcare staff and other admitted patients crossinfection. Patients with COVID-19 are transferred in an “open circuit” even with the maximal strict adherence to the",

        "paperAbstract": "Background : Early-stage interventions in a potential pandemic are important to understand as they can make the difference between runaway exponential growth that is hard to turn back and stopping the spread before it gets that far. COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods : I examine three factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread, differences in use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine and cloth face masks. Results : Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. A study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are will also inform policy on universal mask wearing. Conclusions : While a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread.",

        "paperAbstract": "The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as one of the major drug targets for COVID-19 We have identified the experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against the closely related (96% sequence identity, 100% active site conservation) Mpro of SARS-CoV We developed QSAR models of these inhibitors and employed these models for virtual screening of all drugs in the DrugBank database Similarity searching and molecular docking were explored in parallel, but docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so it was not relied upon for prospective virtual screening Forty-two compounds were identified by our models as consensus computational hits Subsequent to our computational studies, NCATS reported the results of experimental screening of their drug collection in SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay (https://opendata ncats nih gov/covid19/) Coincidentally, NCATS tested 11 of our 42 hits, and three of them, cenicriviroc (AC50 of 8 9 µM), proglumetacin (tested twice independently, with AC50 of 8 9 µM and 12 5 µM), and sufugolix (12 6 µM), were shown to be active These observations support the value of our modeling approaches and models for guiding the experimental investigations of putative anti-COVID-19 drug candidates All the data and models are publicly available via Supplementary Materials and Web https://github com/alvesvm/sars-cov-mpro and https://chembench mml unc edu/",

        "paperAbstract": "BACKGROUND\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly discovered multi-organ disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there are no official guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a licensed antiviral treatment against HIV and has shown activity against other coronaviruses.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn this study, we review the evidence of the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as a potential treatment candidate against COVID-19.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020182067). A systematic search of the literature for the observational and randomized controlled trial was conducted in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar through May 2nd, 2020. Two reviewers independently searched and selected. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Jadad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment tool, and National Institute of Health quality assessment tool.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,965 articles were screened from which 6 articles were selected. Of 6 articles that were included in this study, 4 reported no significant benefit in clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to standard care of treatment, while 2 studies reported otherwise. Lopinavir/ritonavir was also not associated with a reduction of 28-day mortality rate as reported by 1 included study. Most included studies reported gastrointestinal symptoms as side effects from lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is not yet enough evidence to support the regular use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID19. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate lopinavir/ritonavir's efficacy in treatment.",

        "title": "Role of S protein in thromboembolic complications during COVID19 and activated protein C as a serious therapeutic avenue in severe forms of patients",
        "paperAbstract": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international con-cern. There is a pressing urgency to find treatments based upon currently available scien-tific knowledge and epidemiological data. In this article, we provide a novel hypothesis describing how the severity of the pathology is mainly resulting from the Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) and not due to the direct action of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to alter the endothelial cell. The pathophysiological mecha-nism is not yet elucidated. The damage caused resembles a systemic, multi-organ vascu-litis predominantly in the lungs. An increase in thromboembolic complications has been observed in COVID-19 patients. These are manifested by pulmonary embolisms or systemic microembolism manifested by microangiopathy affecting the lungs, brain, liver, kidneys and intestines. Therefore, we hypothesize that an auto-immune acquired Protein S (PS) deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in Covid-19. Auto-antibodies to Protein S may form immune complexes, inducing increased clearance of PS or interfering with the protein C-protein S system. COVID-19 early thromboprophy-laxis in infected patients, or even effective anticoagulation, could prevent the progression to severe forms, thus reducing mortality in patients with COVID-19. Activated Protein C (APC), a physiological coagulation inhibitor with cytoprotective properties, could be an interesting avenue for the treatment of severe forms of the disease in intensive care; its administration in hypoxic patients could improve tissue oxygenation. Randomized resus-citation studies in patients with COVID19 are also needed to confirm our hypothesis.",

        "paperAbstract": "To the Editor: It is with substantial disappointment that we recently read the “Letter: May Cooler Heads Prevail During a Pandemic: Stroke in COVID-19 Patients or COVID-19 in Stroke Patients?”1 At a time when continued denial of the reality that is COVID-19 is causing our country to set new records daily for the numbers of new cases and expected death estimates continue to rise, we would hope that Drs Spiotta and Alawieh would seek to pursue a course based on evidence and not assumptions. Our report, as accepted and published in the NEJM, is a factual account of our observation of a higher than usual number of young patients with large vessel stroke presenting during the peak of the COVID19 in New York City. They even go as far as to accuse our group of providing “misinformation.” They base this conclusion on what can be factually demonstrated as blatantly incorrect and unscientific statements. This is all the more surprising as they are making their assumptions from a position of having essentially zero experience directly dealing with this Pandemic at the time of their writing this letter. South Carolina and Georgia are only just now seeing COVID-19 at any significant rate (though still well below NYC at its peak), and they may now have to learn to take this disease as seriously as it deserves (https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirusdisease-2019-covid-19/sc-testing-data-projections-covid-19 and https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus-georgia-covid-dashboard/ jvoLBozRtBSVSNQDDAuZxH/). To help clarify the scientific and factual inaccuracies as presented by Drs Spiotta and Alawieh, we provide the following brief responses to the statements made in their letter1:",

        "paperAbstract": "Objectives To balance the costs and effects comparing a strict lockdown versus a flexible social distancing strategy for societies affected by Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19). Design Cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants We used societal data and COVID-19 mortality rates from the public domain. Interventions The intervention was a strict lockdown strategy that has been followed by Denmark. Reference strategy was flexible social distancing policy as was applied by Sweden. We derived mortality rates from COVID-19 national statistics, assumed the expected life years lost from each COVID-19 death to be 11 years and calculated lost life years until 31st August 2020. Expected economic costs were derived from gross domestic productivity (GDP) statistics from each country's official statistics bureau and forecasted GDP. The incremental financial costs of the strict lockdown were calculated by comparing Sweden with Denmark using externally available market information. Calculations were projected per one million inhabitants. In sensitivity analyses we varied the total cost of the lockdown (range -50% to +100%). Main outcome measure Financial costs per life years saved. Results In Sweden, the number of people who died with COVID-19 was 577 per million inhabitants, resulting in an estimated 6,350 life years lost per million inhabitants. In Denmark, where a strict lockdown strategy was installed for months, the number of people dying with COVID-19 was on average 111 per million, resulting in an estimated 1,216 life years per million inhabitants lost. The incremental costs of strict lockdown to save one life year was US$ 137,285, and higher in most of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Comparisons of public health interventions for COVID-19 should take into account life years saved and not only lost lives. Strict lockdown costs more than US$ 130,000 per life year saved. As our all our assumptions were in favour of strict lockdown, a flexible social distancing policy in response to COVID19 is defendable.",

        "title": "Virtual House Calls: Telemedicine and Reforming the Health Care Delivery Model with Strategies Implemented in a Novel Coronavirus Pandemic",
        "paperAbstract": "D uring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Covid-19), the US Centers for Medicare andMedicaid expanded coverage to allow clinicians to temporarily see patients though telemedicine visits instead of traditional office visits . Telemedicine has been a revolutionary tool for clinicians in this pandemic because it enabled continued medical care while maintaining social distancing and allowed patients who are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection the ability to get medical assessments without leaving their homes . With the utility of telemedicine being proven in this pandemic, it strengthens the argument that the utilization of telemedicine should be incorporated into routine medical care. Traditional office visits can be difficult for patients and providers. For patients, office visits led to long commutes, wait times, and increased exposure to infectious diseases, with health care providers also at increased risk of infection . Additionally, the routine physical examination, which is an integral part of a traditional office visit, often does not contribute to the medical plan. For example, annual physicals have been found to have no effect on total mortality, cancer mortality, and likely no effect on cardiovascular mortality or risk of strokes . Studies found that the majority of diagnosis is attributed to the medical history and little from the physical exam . Furthermore, telehealth visits can include focused physical examination maneuvers using imageand audiocapturing devices to assess the dermatologic, cardiac, and pulmonary systems . With risks of transmissible infections, like the annual influenza epidemic, which led to higher mortality rates than Covid19 at the time Covid-19 was declared pandemic, the benefits of telehealth should not be restricted after the Covid-19 pandemic ends. Through telehealth systems, it has been found that patients with chronic illnesses had better mortality, quality of life, and hospital readmission outcomes . A study also found that 95% of patients who participated in a telehealth visit rated it as good as, if not better than, a traditional office visit . It is now, in a time of crisis, that we should embrace innovation, not for just in this moment, but for the future. We must incorporate the technology that we have already leveraged, and further invest in novel approaches to improve the safety, experience, and capability of telehealth to optimize health care delivery without sacrificing quality. Though modern technology, doctors can again travel to patient homes with a modern version of a physician house call.",

        "title": "Fogging IBD Management: An Unusual Case of IBD Flare-up During the COVID-19 Outbreak",
        "paperAbstract": "To the Editors, We have read with interest the article by Occhipinti and Pastorelli, with particular reference to the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) relapse during the COVID-19 outbreak.1 Diagnostic challenges may arise in the presence of symptoms that overlap between active IBD and COVID-19, and concerns about the use of immunosuppressive drugs, mainly corticosteroids, which potentially lead to an increased risk for infections.2 Lombardy, in northern Italy where our clinic is located, has been severely hit by COVID-19 since February 2020. We hereby report on a representative case of how COVID-19 has redefined priorities and changed our clinical approach to active IBD patients. In April 2020, a 29-year-old man with a 1-year history of ulcerative colitis (UC) on maintenance with mesalamine was admitted to our clinic with a 2-week history of fever up to 38.5°C, bloody diarrhea, dry cough, and ageusia. Physical examination revealed tachycardia. Blood tests showed neutrophilia and increased C-reactive protein. Two consecutive nasopharyngeal plus one rectal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 tested negative. A contrast-enhanced chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan revealed no signs of pneumonia but a widely thickened and hyper-enhancing colonic wall (Fig. 1A). Abdominal imaging and gastrointestinal symptoms were consistent with IBD relapse. However, the persistence of fever, cough, and ageusia made it necessary to definitely rule COVID-19 out. After a multidisciplinary discussion, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which eventually tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Ileocolonoscopy, performed 2 days later, showed segmental cobblestone appearance and scattered aphthous erosions in the right and left colon (Fig. 1B), as opposed to a relative sparing of the rectum (Fig. 1C). Histological examination was consistent with IBD colitis. A diagnosis of severe flare of IBD-unclassified was made, and corticosteroid therapy was initiated, with the subsequent rapid improvement of both gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. Gastrointestinal manifestations have occurred in about half of COVID19 patients and may precede respiratory symptoms.3 Therefore, the differential diagnosis between IBD relapse and SARS-CoV-2 infection has possibly proved challenging at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently, ruling out COVD-19 has become a priority for both clinical and public health reasons, and the timing of endoscopic examination, as well as treatment decisions, closely depend on the COVID-19 diagnostic results.4 Ageusia and anosmia have been reported in about one third of COVID-19 patients,5 whereas they have rarely been observed in IBD patients. Ageusia, as reported by our patient, contributed to increase the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and made the differential diagnosis trickier.

        "title": "COVID-19: Is there a weaker sex?",
        "paperAbstract": "Sex is one of the most relevant factors often associated with health, disease severity, mortality, and life expectancy [1]. From neonatal diseases to non-communicable disorders, men often have higher risks and poorer prognosis; however, the causes of these disparities are still subject to debate [2–7]. In this context, the new coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has again called attention to these differences, mainly due to the observations of a higher level of complications and fatality rates among men [8]. According to data from the Global Health 50/50 initiative, which collects sex-disaggregated information from COVID19 cases worldwide, from the 75 countries reporting case and death data by sex, 63 revealed a male:female ratio of mortality over 1, three countries having a value of 1 and only nine a ratio below this mark (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a recent study observed that although the male: female ratio of deaths per 100,000 individuals varied by age, the probability of death remained higher in males across all age categories [9]. In addition, a recently published study from India revealed that themagnitude of the differential risk by sex was higher as age increased, suggesting a role of age in this association [10]. Beyond these population observations, several studies have concluded that male sex is a risk factor for COVID-19 adverse outcomes, even in multivariate analyses after adjusting for potential confounders [11–14]. The association between male gender and adverse outcomes, such asmortality, seems consistent across all geographical areas, as revealed by several meta-analyses [15–18]. The reasons for this trend are likely to be multifactorial, including physiological factors, lifestyle, and socio-cultural behaviors [19] (Fig. 2). The physiological differences between the sexes may initially be directly involved in this differential risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes [20]. For example, recent evidence has suggested that SARSCoV-2 expression may induce angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) downregulation due to the binding of the viral spike protein to its receptor, then promoting a decrease in the angiotensin[1–7] production [21]. In this context, there is evidence suggesting an important role of sex hormones in the regulation of ACE-2 in a tissue-specific manner [20]. For example, female mice were observed to have a higher expression of ACE-2 in adipose tissue compared with male mice, leading to higher levels of Ang[1–7], which in turn were associated with lower levels of hypertension, another risk factor for COVID-19 negative outcomes [22,23]. Similarly, higher testosterone levels in males may be related to a higher risk of coagulation disorders, resulting in complications such as venous thromboembolism and systemic embolisms, which are frequently observed in severe COVID-19 patients [24,25]. Furthermore, differences in the immune responses against SARSCoV-2 between sexes may also play an important role. Takahashi et al.",

        "title": "Management for patients with pediatric surgical disease during the COVID-19 epidemic",
        "paperAbstract": "The recent ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads around the world. By March 31, this global pandemic has infected about 700,000 cases in more than 203 countries/regions and 33,257 people have lost their lives. A recent study reported that only 2.16% (965/44,672) of infected patients were aged 19 years or younger [1]. Although children are supposed to be less susceptible to COVID-19, the true infected rate of children may be understated because some children with asymptomatic and mild infections are unlikely to be tested [2]. Besides, in addition to the COVID-19 itself, the relative shortage of medical resources caused by a surge in the number of coronavirus patients and accompanying economic downturn may also affect the diagnosis and management plan for children with surgical disease. Hence, the treatment plans for pediatric surgical disease during the COVID-19 outbreak deserve attention. For confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2-infected children, although some of them may present as mild or even symptomless infections, the virus may “awaken” and the symptoms may worsen with the progression of SARSCoV-2 infection. Besides, although it remains unclear whether infected children with cancer are associated with poor prognosis, it seems that the tumor itself and its corresponding treatment may weaken the immune response to pathogenic microorganisms, and further make the COVID19 worse. Hence, a priority of treating the COVID-19 and a short delay in surgical treatment (or oncotherapy) may be an optimal option for those infected children without presenting a surgical emergency. In a recent report about infected children from Wuhan, 18 of 20 children were cured with an average stay of 12.9 days (8–20 days) [3]. Hence, the delay may not seem long. The incubation period from exposure to symptoms for most patients with COVID-19 varies from 3 to 14 days [4], suspected infected children should be, therefore, quarantined for at least 14 days to ensure safety. However, for those who developed a life-threatening emergency (such as the acute abdomen and severe hydrocephalus), although emergent operation may be a risky practice in children with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, it may still be the only life-saving method when conservative treatment fails. It is recommended to simplify the surgical procedure and to minimize the trauma to children. The “radical surgery” should be chosen cautiously after a multidisciplinary assessment. In surgical treatment recommendations for confirmed/suspected adult, laparoscopic surgery is considered dangerous because it may carry the risk of aerosol transmission [5]. However, the balance between the real risk of cross-infection and the benefits of minimally invasive surgery should be carefully assessed [6]. Appropriately reducing the pneumoperitoneum pressure, preventing the gas leakage from the trocar sites, and slowly removing the “aerosol” via aspirator after pneumoperitoneum may be possible solutions to lower the risk of cross-infection. Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and giving the necessary treatment should be the main treatment principles for treating children with pediatric surgical diseases but without COVID-19. Elective operations (such as cosmetic procedures) could be postponed modestly as invasive procedures as well as anesthesia may influence the children’s immunity, which increases their susceptibility. However, the outbreak may last for months, for urgent and some “time-sensitive” diseases, unduly delay in surgery may miss the “critical * Long Li lilong23@126.com",

        "paperAbstract": "Reconstructing the dynamic response of the Antarctic ice sheets to warming during the Last Glacial Termination (LGT; 18,000–11,650 yrs ago) allows us to disentangle ice-climate feedbacks that are key to improving future projections. Whilst the sequence of events during this period is reasonably well-known, relatively poor chronological control has precluded precise alignment of ice, atmospheric and marine records, making it difficult to assess relationships between Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) dynamics, climate change and sea level. Here we present results from a highly-resolved ‘horizontal ice core’ from the Weddell Sea Embayment, which records millennial-scale AIS dynamics across this extensive region. Counterintuitively, we find AIS mass-loss across the full duration of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14,600–12,700 yrs ago), with stabilisation during the subsequent millennia of atmospheric warming. Earth-system and ice-sheet modelling suggests these contrasting trends were likely Antarctic-wide, sustained by feedbacks amplified by the delivery of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf. Given the anti-phase relationship between inter-hemispheric climate trends across the LGT our findings demonstrate that Southern Ocean-AIS feedbacks were controlled by global atmospheric teleconnections. With increasing stratification of the Southern Ocean and intensification of mid-latitude westerly winds today, such teleconnections could amplify AIS mass loss and accelerate global sea-level rise.",

        "title": "The challenge of ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis in COVID-19 patients",
        "paperAbstract": "While different phenotypes have been evidenced in ICU COVID-19 pneumonia [1], most patients meet ARDS Berlin definition associating bilateral radiologic infiltrates with severe hypoxemia. COVID-19 patients frequently require prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) including prone positioning, heavy sedation, and muscle blockers for several weeks. In addition, there is clear evidence of prolonged immunosuppression including deep lymphopenia [2]. This accounts for a high risk of secondary hospital-acquired infections, primarily ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The diagnosis of ventilator-associated infections remains challenging due to major definition heterogeneity of multiple clinical entities, and no consensus has yet been reached on appropriate diagnostic strategies for VAP. Irrespective of the definition, accurate diagnosis of VAP requires clinical signs of infection, microbiological documentation, and chest X-ray findings, even if the latter may be difficult to interpret due to preexisting parenchymal injury [3]. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia is relatively homogenous and commonly associates high fever, hyperleukocytosis, severe hypoxemia, extensive bilateral radiologic infiltrates, and biological inflammatory syndrome. Since this presentation is shared with VAP, traditional diagnostic criteria for VAP are not valid in the critical COVID19 population. Similarly, the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), assessing body temperature, tracheal secretions, radiologic infiltrate, hyperleukocytosis, and PaO2/FiO2, has little additional value since its components overlap with those of COVID-19 pneumonia in MV patients [4]. In our experience, more than 90% of COVID-19 patients had qualifying CPIS > 6 on day 2 following ICU admission in the absence of any documented VAP or co-infection. Accordingly, the microbiological documentation from deep respiratory secretions currently remains the sole criterion to support VAP diagnosis in COVID-19 patients. Fiberoptic bronchoalveolar lavage is hardly feasible in severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients due to the inherent risk of worsening hypoxemia. Hence, many ICU perform less invasive endotracheal aspirate (ETA) with quantitative or semiquantitative cultures, even if less reliable for deciding whether to institute antibiotic treatment or not. It is near impossible to distinguish COVID-19-associated ARDS with asymptomatic bacterial colonization from a true VAP based solely on traditional threshold values (i.e., 10 CFU/ml for ETA). Interestingly, despite heavy bacterial load, white blood cell count in bronchial secretions appears very low in most COVID-19 patients developing a superinfection. Accurate identification of COVID-19 patients who require treatment with new antibiotics for a clinically relevant bacterial superinfection is difficult, leading to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics despite the absence of supporting data in the literature [5]. As a result, most ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS are treated with prophylactic antibiotics to prevent from undocumented VAP. Such a strategy is at high risk of selection of multi-drug-resistant bacteria or even fungi in patients expected to remain under invasive MV for a long period. The COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of its clinical presentation cannot justify “emotional” and blind antibiotic therapy on the sole argument that traditional VAP definition is invalid. Specific COVID-19 antimicrobial stewardship and guidelines are required to avoid this detrimental approach, considering that within the first 10 days, most of the pathogens documented in the lung are from the community with minimal resistant profile (unpublished data). While it is reasonable to initiate antibiotics in patients with suspected VAP and hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia following European guidelines [6] regardless of clinical certainty, a more conservative approach may be beneficial for stable patients (Fig. 1). It remains to be seen whether routine assessment tools such as daily variations of CPIS score,",

        "paperAbstract": "An outbreak, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), may facilitate relapse of psychotic disorders through outcome, such as social distancing, lockdown or change in the priority of health services [1]. Besides the effects of the outbreak, lack of insight, non-adherence to treatment, poor social and cognitive functioning observed in psychotic disorders may make it difficult to maintain treatment [2]. Non-adherence to treatment is a major risk factor for relapse in individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [3, 4]. Using long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) may be a solution against the risk of relapse under outbreak conditions. Community mental health centers (CMHCs) may be protective against the risk of relapse, but their delivery of care is also affected by the outbreak. They might have to develop and implement new interventions as the outbreak commands [5], but few evidence exists to design a relevant plan for relapse prevention [6] and to apply a sustainable clinical practice [7]. In this background, we aimed to detect the relapse rate of patients registered at Etimesgut CMHC, Ankara, to investigate the basic characteristics of patients who experienced relapse during the first trimester (from 10th of March to 10th of June) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey, and to compare main findings with the same period in 2019 as being suggested by Moreno et al. [7]. Our CMHC had been closed between 23 March and 13 April 2020 because the team was initially assigned to Etimesgut State Hospital for the outbreak until mid-April. Once reopened, telepsychiatry monitoring at CMHC was initiated once/twice a week or biweekly according to the patient’s clinical status. From a number of total 188 patients, 155 could be contacted. The medical charts of these 155 patients (schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder n = 131 [84%], bipolar disorder n = 24 [16%]) were investigated retrospectively. The demographic, clinical characteristics and medication adherence of the patients were recorded. Relapse criteria were defined as: (1) psychiatric hospitalization, (2) admission to emergency department (ER) for psychiatric reasons, (3) discontinuing antipsychotics (defined as not using oral formulations for a week or delaying the next LAI injection for two weeks), (4) new onset of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempt, and (5) non-suicidal self-harm or violent behavior. The mean age of the sample was 46.6 ± 12.5, with a mean duration of education 9 ± 3.6 years. Most of the patients were male (68%), single/separated (59%), unemployed (56%) and living with their families (90%). The mean duration of illness was 20 ± 10.6, and follow-up duration at the CMHC was 2.9 ± 1.5 years. The median number of previous hospitalization was 2 (min–max: 0–10, IQR:2), and the median duration after the last hospitalization was 6 years (min–max: 0–30, IQR: 4). The relapse rate of the patients in the first trimester of COVID-19 outbreak was 11% (bipolar disorder n = 2, schizophrenia n = 15). Most of the patients who experienced relapse reported discontinuation of antipsychotics (59%). In addition, 2 patients were hospitalized, 4 were admitted to the ER, 2 had new onset of suicidal thoughts/suicide attempt, and 3 showed self-harm or violent behavior. The relapse and the non-relapse groups were similar regarding age, gender, duration of education, employment and marital status, diagnosis, duration of illness and followup and the number of previous hospitalizations (p > 0.05). The relapse group had been hospitalized more recently * Emre Mutlu mutluemre12@gmail.com",

        "paperAbstract": "As I write this editorial, much of the world is locked down to attempt to stop the spread of the Covid19 virus. There will be many studies in the future about how the virus spread and the different technical, political, and social responses to it across the globe. Assessments will be made of the structures of health systems, resources required to confront the pandemic, and implications for rich and poor countries alike. I would argue that one thing which is already becoming clear is that public health systems have been neglected and in doing so many will needlessly suffer illness and death. The history of medicine shows that many historical causes of lower life expectancy and illness were resolved through public health interventions such as sanitation, water, vaccination campaigns, in other words public not individual health interventions, a point that unfortunately has not been sufficiently recognised. It has been said that politicians and donors like high-profile programmes, large new hospitals, but no politician wants to be seen opening a new sewerage pipe. The current crisis shows that only coordinated national action can really cope with the threat of the sort of crisis now being confronted. Whatever future studies reveal, it is already certain that national-level health services with a focus on public health should be forefront on government agendas. The pandemic is a reminder that for the rich and poor only a public service approach to health can avoid or mitigate the sort of challenges currently being dealt with. Poorly coordinated and organised mixed systems which prioritise private health systems and underfund public ones will be shown to lack the ability to act efficiently and in the interests of all. In this issue of Development in Practice, we have several articles investigating issues around food security, some from a health perspective of excessive stunting, and poor general health. Although studies often focus on the need to ensure programmes, services, and systems are appropriate to the local context, they also tend towards recognising the need for public coordination, research, and procurement policies around food security to ensure scaled up, sustainable solutions to food insecurity. As such there are reflections in the current public health crisis, of the need for governments to ensure a strategic focus on issues affecting all citizens rather than just fortunate minorities. Another area which will be under scrutiny as the pandemic hopefully recedes will be the way in which international development is carried out. Our sector has been dependent on cheaper accessible international flights. Environmentalists have already pointed out the damage caused by the massive increase in air travel. It is almost certain that air travel will, and probably should, become more expensive in the future. So howwill that change our readiness to endlessly travel for often short visits to distant shores, whether for project visits, conferences, evaluations, or the many other reasons we have found ourselves on long-haul flights in the past? As we now sit at home using Skype, Zoom, and emails to communicate with people will our previous ways of working become redundant? The importance of agricultural marketing information for small-scale producers in Pakistan is the starting point for the article by Muhammad Yaseen and Mokbul Morshed Ahmad. In practice, the system in Punjab did not live up to the needs of farmers either in terms of communicating prices nor in terms of the quality and reliability of data provided. This critical review provides pointers towards improving the agricultural marketing system. Adeline Doubahan Coulibaly and Kimseyinga Savadogo attempt to answer whether fertiliser subsidy increases maize productivity in Burkina Faso, while being aware of the controversies behind the subsidy of agricultural inputs. The authors provide a balanced account of the issues confronted in this case study. One firm conclusion is that small-scale farmers who are members of farmers’ groups are more likely to make the best use of such subsidised support.",

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei, China, in December 2019 raised a worldwide concern. Cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first described and the pathogen responsible was later identified as being a novel betacoronavirus [1]. Named as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), this virus is responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. The outbreak began in the east of France during the first days of March after a religious meeting gathering about 2000 people, which took place in Mulhouse from 17th to 24th February 2020. The Groupe Hospitalier de la Region de Mulhouse Sud-Alsace (GHRMSA) is a hospital complex including 10 sites with a total capacity of 2612 beds and covering the needs of 480,000 people. Intensive care facilities are located on the main site, Emile Muller Hospital, with a capacity of 824 general beds and 2 ICUs, one medical of 20 beds and one surgical of 16 beds. The first patient presenting with respiratory failure was admitted to medical ICU on March 2nd, 2020. After 4 days, 10 patients with COVID-19 were admitted. Non-COVID-19 patients were transferred from medical to surgical ICU in the first week in order to increase ICU surge capacity for COVID19 patients. In the beginning of the second week, all medical ICU beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. The cardiac surgery ICU (4 beds) was transformed to a COVID-19 ICU, as scheduled surgical and medical activity was stopped. Sixteen additional beds were added in five operative and post-operative rooms. Eight beds “non-COVID-19” ICU was created in another postoperative room. Surgical ICU was also converted into COVID-19 ICU. On week 3 of the outbreak, in an unprecedented manner in France, a 30-bed field military intensive care hospital was deployed on the hospital car park by the French military medical service: the Élément Militaire de Réanimation du Service de Santé des Armées (EMRSSA). So as to cope with this massive flood, a national as well as an international cooperation was setup and many patients were transferred to receptive ICUs outside the region via Alsace Regional Health Agency coordinating office, assessed by a military coordinating office, by helicopter, trains and military aircrafts in France, Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland. From March 2nd to April 26th, 2020, 1249 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the hospital. Among them, 278 were hospitalized in ICU. Forty-four patients were discharged from ICU, 118 were transferred to another ICU, and 42 are died. The field military intensive care hospital admitted 47 patients during the same period. Surges in the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had occurred rapidly. Thus, ICU practitioners and hospital administrators had to adapt the capacity of ICU beds in number, and also in equipment, consumables, pharmaceuticals, and staffing. The staff was composed of intensivists and anesthesiologist-intensivists with one intensivist in charge of patients’ orientation every day. Nursing team was composed of ICU nurses and nurse anesthetists. The EMRSSA mission aimed to achieve two main objectives under strenuous conditions: first to treat critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) according to the best Open Access",
